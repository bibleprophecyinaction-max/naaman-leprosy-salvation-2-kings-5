# Naaman – The Captain of Syria (2 Kings 5 Explained)

Naaman was a mighty and honourable captain — but he was a leper.

Leprosy in Scripture illustrates sin.

When he came to Elisha for healing, he expected a dramatic display.  
Instead, he was told to wash in the Jordan seven times.

At first he was angry.  
But when he humbled himself and obeyed, he was completely healed.

Naaman received not only physical healing but also spiritual awakening.

Salvation is just as simple — by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ.

We are all infected with the leprosy of sin.  
Only Christ can cleanse us.

If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you will receive forgiveness and eternal life.
